    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>Project Duration: [14th February-25th May]</p>

  <section id="problem-goal">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Busy workers lack the time to prepare a homemade meal.</p>

    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p>Design an app for FastFood that allows users to easily order their favourite fast-food at a location near their workplace and get it delivered to them real quick.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="role-responsibilities">
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>As a Product Manager for the fast food app, I led the project from concept to launch, ensuring that we delivered a seamless and user-friendly experience for our customers. </p>

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>User Experience Design: Collaborated with the UX/UI design team to create intuitive and attractive interfaces. Ensured that the app's design was user-centric and accessible.</li>
      <li>Customer Support: Set up customer support processes and tools to handle user inquiries and issues efficiently. Analyzed customer feedback to continuously improve the app.</li>
      <li>Feature Development: Defined and prioritized app features based on customer feedback and business goals</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="user-research">
    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I am designing for and 
      their needs. A primary user group identified through research was adults with flexible 
      job hours and who needed to have consistency when it came to meal choice.
    </p>
    <p>The user group confirmed initial assumptions about FastFood customers, but research aslo
      revealed that convenience, payment choices, and allergen info were important to make the 
      order process on the app a more seamless experience. The fact that FastFood is a nationwide franchise,
      customers who may need to have consistent food quality and meal choices at any time of the day
      delivered to their jobsite is extremely possible.

  <section id="usability-study">
    <h2>Usability Study</h2>
    <p>I conducted two rounds of usability studies. Finding from the first study helped guide the designs for wireframes to mockups.
      The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed refining.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Finding 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Users want to reorder favourite meals using accounts</li>
      <li>Users want to see their delivery ETA and driver details</li>
      <li>Users want to be able to tip their delivery driver</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Finding 2</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Users need to view allergen info</li>
      <li>Users want mutiple payment types</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="accessibility">
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provided access to users who are vision impaired to call in for the order</li>
      <li>Used icons to make navigation easier</li>
      <li>Used detailed imagery for meals and the allergen info to help all users better understand the design</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="takeaways">
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Impact: The app makes users feel like FastFood really thinks about how to meet their customers nedds</li>
      <li>What I learned: While designing the FastFood app, I learned that the first ideas for the 
        app are only a starting point and usability studies lead to great onfluences each iteration of the app's designs
      </li>
     
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct another round of usability studies to validate whether pain points that users experienced have been effectively addressed</li>
      <li>Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need</li>
      <li>Deliver the design to engineers to start in creating the back-end for the app</li>
    </ul>
